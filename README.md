# Covid19 Detection Using Image Classification

In this Problem we have used Tensorflow Library for building, training and testing the model. We have build a Sequential model to do Image Classification of Covid-19 CTSCANS images. That were captured by Doctors of different hospitals. We have build Convolutional Neural Network to do image classification because Covolutional Neural Networks are good at image processing and image related tasks.

Here are the results of our trained model we have got amazing accuracy from the trained CNN.
